Apple___Apple_scab,Apple,Apple scab,"Yellow or chlorotic spots on leaves,
dark olive green spots on leaves and fruit,
may be a velvety growth on spots on undersides of leaves, 
twisting of leaves, 
distorted leaves, 
severely infected leaves turn yellow and drop from tree.",Fungus Venturia inaequalis,"Fungus overwinters on dead foliage on ground,
spores dispersed by wind,
high moisture encourages fungal growth.","Remove all fallen leaves from trees in the fall and compost to prevent any disease infestations in the debris.
It may be necessary to add Zinc and fertilizer-grade urea in the fall to speed leaf drop, then add lime to fallen leaves.
Using fungicide may be necessary for areas where leaves remain wet for periods of more than 9 hours.
Fungicides such as copper soaps and Bordeaux mixture should be applied if there is a chance of a wet period as soon as leaf tips emerge."
Apple___Black_rot,Apple,Black rot,"Purple flecks or circular lesions which are brown in the centre and purple at margin; 
red flecks, purple lesions and/or brown black rings on fruit.",Fungus,Spores can overwinter in twigs or fruit remaining on the tree and spread during rainfall.,"Remove dead wood, mummified fruit and cankers from trees to reduce spread of disease;
burn any prunings that have been made from the tree;
disease can be controlled by applying fungicides from silver tip to harvest."
Apple___Cedar_apple_rust,Apple,Cedar apple rust,"Bright orange or yellow patches on top side of leaves surrounded by a red band and small black spots in the center;
by mid-summer, cup-like structures called aecia form on the leaf undersides; 
these become covered in tubular structures from which spores are released.",Fungus,"Fungus requires two hosts to complete lifecycle;
forms galls on Eastern red cedar and spores are carried by wind to apple;
use caution when planting apple close to red cedar.","Plant resistant varieties where possible;
remove nearby red cedar;
if growing susceptible varieties in proximity to red cedar follow a fungicide program."
Cherry_(including_sour)___Powdery_mildew,Cherry_(including_sour),Powdery mildew,"Light colored circular lesions on leaves inside tree canopy which develop a powdery appearance; 
lesions may coalesce to cover leaf; 
if infection is severe, leaves may blister and infected shoots may be distorted and stunted; 
infected fruits may have slightly depressed areas on the surface containing fungal hyphae (filamentous fungal structures).",Fungus,Infection of fruit is more likely if there are rainfalls close to harvest.,Management of powdery mildew in cherry is reliant on the application of appropriate fungicides and cultural practices which promote good air circulation around tree canopies to lower humidity.
Corn_(maize)___Cercospora_leaf_spot_Gray_leaf_spot,Corn_(maize),Cercospora leaf spot Gray leaf spot,"Small necrotic (brown or tan) spots that may have a yellow chlorotic halo appear on lower leaves, usually before flowering. 
Gradually these lesions will turn grayish and appear on younger leaves, too. 
As the disease progresses, they enlarge into elongated, rectangular lesions that run parallel to the leaf veins. 
In optimal conditions (warm temperatures, high humidity and wet leaves), they can coalesce and engulf the whole leaf. 
If this happens before grain filling there can be considerable yield losses. 
The leaf blight can weaken the plants and sometimes soften the stalks, leading to lodging.",Fungus,"The gray leaf spot disease is caused by the fungus Cercospora zeae-maydis.
It survives in plant residues in the soil for long periods of time.
During the spring, the spores are carried onto the lower leaves by rain splashes and wind.
Its lifecycle is favored by elevated temperatures (25 to 30°C), high humidity (dews, fogs) and leaf wetness for prolonged periods of time.
Hot, dry weather hinders its development.
Symptoms vary slightly between different plant varieties.
The fungus completes its lifecycle (from infection to production of new spores) in 14-21 days in a susceptible variety and in 21-28 days in a resistant one. ","Always consider an integrated approach with preventive measures and biological treatments if available.
Foliar fungicide treatment is a way to manage the disease if it occurs at early stages but it has to be weighted against the weather conditions, the potential yield loss and the susceptibility of the plant.
Fungicides containing pyraclostrobin and strobilurin, or combinations of azoxystrobin and propiconazole, prothioconazole and trifloxystrobin work well to control the fungus."
Corn_(maize)___Common_rust_,Corn_(maize),Common rust ,"Oval or elongated cinnamon brown pustules on upper and lower surfaces of leaves;
pustules rupture and release powdery red spores;
pustules turn dark brown-black as they mature and release dark brown powdery spores;
if infection is severe, pustules may appear on tassels and ears and leaves may begin to yellow;
in partially resistant corn hybrids, symptoms appear as chlorotic or necrotic flecks on the leaves which release little or no spore.",Fungus,"Disease is spread by wind-borne spores;
some of the most popularly grown sweet corn varieties have little or no resistance to the disease.","The most effective method of controlling the disease is to plant resistant hybrids;
application of appropriate fungicides may provide some degree on control and reduce disease severity;
fungicides are most effective when the amount of secondary inoculum is still low, generally when plants only have a few rust pustules per leaf."
Corn_(maize)___Northern_Leaf_Blight,Corn_(maize),Northern Leaf Blight,"In the beginning we will notice elliptical gray-green lesions on leaves.
As the disease process this lesions become pale gray to tan color.
Later stage the lesions looks dirty due to dark gray spores particularly under lower leaf surface.
The disease can be easily identified in the field due to its long, narrow lesions which are unrestricted by veins.",Fungus,The disease mainly spread through rain splash and wind.,"Follow proper tillage to reduce fungus inoculum from crop debris.
Follow crop rotation with non host crop.
Grow available resistant varieties.
In severe case of disease incidence apply suitable fungicide."
Grape___Black_rot,Grape,Black rot,"Brown lesions on the leaves that develop black dots (pycnidia); 
grapes have light spots that eventually form pycnidia; 
grapes harden and turn black, while still remaining on the vine.",Fungus,"Disease favors rainy weather;

cultivate soil during bud break to bury mummies and reduce inoculant;
application of appropriate fungicides can help control the disease."
Grape___Esca_(Black_Measles),Grape,Esca (Black Measles),"Symptom appears on leaves, trunk, canes and berries. 
On leaves we will see intervenaial striping looks like tiger strips. 
White cultivars shows chlorotic and necrotic strips where as red cultivars shows red areas and necrotic strips. 
On berries we will see superficial spots and later may coalesce making berries appear black. 
Trunk/arm/cordons shows dark brown black vascular streaking and oozes dark sap when we cut trunk. 
Some time this measles in associate with numerous secondary wood rotting fungi which decorate the vineyard completely.",Fungus,"The leaf and berry symptoms may occur together in single cane or may show symptom on only one parts.
The severe infestation of measles kill grapevine in a single year which is commonly called apoplexy.
The symptoms are common in 5 to 7 year old vineyard.
The prune wounds helps in pathogen entrance and establishment.","Till date there is no effective method to control this disease.
Remove the infected berries, leaves and trunk and destroy them.
Protect the prune wounds to minimize fungal infection using wound sealant (5% boric acid in acrylic paint) or essential oil or suitable fungicides."
Grape___Leaf_blight_(Isariopsis_Leaf_Spot),Grape,Leaf blight (Isariopsis Leaf Spot),"On leaf surface we will see lesions which are irregularly shaped (2 to 25 mm in diameter). 
Initially lesions are dull red to brown in color turn black later. 
If disease is severe this lesions may coalesce. 
On berries we can see symptom similar to black rot but the entire clusters will collapse.",Fungus,"Common in tropical and subtropical grapes.

blotchy mottling and/or green islands (spots) surrounded by completely yellow leaf tissue; 
twig and limbs begin to die back; 
fruits may drop prematurely and are often mishappen and lopsided; 
fruit has a bitter, salty taste.",Bacteria,"Huanglongbing has a complex pathosystem (an ecosystem based on parasitism).
There are multiple strains, diverse hosts, several insect vectors, and different environmental conditions that affect the expression and spread of the disease.
Three forms of the disease are known (Asian, African, and American), and these are associated with different species and strains of Liberibactors that are disseminated by different species of citrus psyllid insect vectors.
The pathogen currently found in the US is Candidatus Liberibacter asiaticus.
Most citrus species, cultivars, and hybrids are susceptible to the disease.
Vectors of the Liberibacters include citrus psyllids Diaphorina citri and Trioza erytreae.
Huanglongbing can also be spread by grafting.
Transmission can occur in the nursery and in the orchard.
Non-citrus hosts have been identified as alternate hosts for the Liberibacters and the citrus psyllids, but their role is still unclear in the epidemiology of the disease.","(i) Cultural control Once a tree becomes infected with HLB, it cannot be cured.
    Control is therefore reliant on preventing the disease occurring in the first place and this is achieved through strict quarantining to prevent the introduction of citrus psyllids to areas which are currently free of the pest.
    Areas which are subject to quarantine have restrictions placed on the movement of citrus plants, fruit, equipment and items made from citrus.
    Infected trees should be removed as quickly as possible from plantations and destroyed.
    Identification of infected trees should be achieved through several surveys to ensure that infected trees which are not yet showing symptoms are identified.
    In Florida, the recommendation is to scout groves at least 4 times a year for disease symptoms.

(ii) Control of citrus psyllids Citrus psyllid populations can be controlled through the application of chemical sprays.
     Insecticides have proved very effective at controlling T. erytreae in South Africa where systemic insecticides are applied to the tree at the base of the trunk."
